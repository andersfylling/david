Things to consider regarding evaluation:
    * Material
        - A term determined by the sum of piece values of each side. The material value is the most influential part of the evaluation. Usually it is the sum of a constant value for each piece present.
    * Mobility
        - a measure of the number of choices (legal moves) a player has in a given position.
          It is often used as a term in the evaluation function of chess programs. It is based on the idea that the more choices you have at your disposal, the stronger your position.

     These to measurements are the first to be implemented in evaluation, later more advanced will be sorted out
